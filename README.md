        FisgEye is a small and simple tool that allows to make the pictures more interesting, applying various effects and filters to them.
        It provides a huge list of diverse effects and filters, you can use freely to style the pics.

### - How to use FishEye?


        1. Inert the image file link in the input field (without the quotes).
        2. After that, there will be a list of effects and filters you can use. 
        3. To use the effect, write a name that's on this list. If the word you enter is not on the list, the programme will return an error message!
        4. Some effects have additional parameters, which you can customise as you wish. 
        FOR EXAMPLE: The Pixelate effect has a parameter called "pixel_size", which you can set to any value you want.
        5. After you have entered the effect name and its parameters (if needed), the programme will return the image you sent with an effect applied to it.
        6. If you want, the programme offers you to save the image. After the image is generated, a question will appear, asking if you want to save the image.
        7. If you want to save the image, type "yes" in the input field, and the image will be saved in the current directory.


### - For FishEye I used:
        - Python 
        - Pillow library
        - Numpy - (for kernel and graphical effects)
